# Thus Spoke Goro Majima
A python script providing you Nietzsche quotes... Spoke by Yakuza characters.

I'd like to add a way to cleanup the data gathered by the spiders (removing unnecessary characters, check the langage used) on top of some general polish, but this project is more or less complete. Enjoy!

Please remember to give the characters.json and quotes.json scripts as arguments when you launch the script (for example: "python main.py characters.json quotes.json")
